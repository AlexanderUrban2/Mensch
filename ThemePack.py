"""
steps to create a new usable theme:
 - create a new directory in /music and /images with the same same
 - fill the directories with the sound/image files you want to use (images must be .png and sounds .wav)
    -> the files must use the same names as the files in the default directory (e.g. GameField.png as the image used
        as the background when you are playing)
 - if you don't provide a file for a specific sound/image the default one will be used
 - you can also change the text colors that are used by adding new colors for your theme in TextColorPack.py
 - now add the name of your directory/theme in THEME_LIST() in main.py
